-- The natural key of an oauth reference row is the store that owns the token
-- plus the row in it. The sync (story 2.5) upserts on this key, so a connection
-- that disappears and comes back reactivates its row instead of producing a
-- second one.
---- Partial index: only oauth rows have an owner, and static rows keep both
-- columns NULL by the coherence CHECK of migration 000019.
